# Snake Game (Ruby 2D)

## Description
This is a simple Snake game built using the Ruby 2D library. The player controls a snake that moves in four directions, eats food to grow, and must avoid colliding with itself. The game ends when the snake runs into itself.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Ruby (Recommended: Version 3.1 or 3.2)

Alternatively, if using Bundler, create a `Gemfile` and install dependencies:

```

## How to Play
1. Run the game using:
```sh
 ruby game.rb
```
2. Control the snake using arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`).
3. Eat the yellow squares to grow in size.
4. Avoid running into yourself.
5. If the game ends, press `R` to restart.
